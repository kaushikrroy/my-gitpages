# Programmer's Notes 
## Thanks to 'Skinny Bones Jekyll', nice theme for Github Pages.

Personal notes on some common programs asked in interviews and other competitive examinations for selection purposes. Programs are in Java and sometimes in Scala too. There are no gaurantees about the correctness of these. These should be treated as notes only. 

These notes no way depict the superiority of either of the programming languages used. I don't have the authority to do so.
